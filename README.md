# 42_philo_tester

Simple tester for the dining philosophers problem of School 42

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thblonde/42_philo_tester.git
cd 42_philo_tester
./tester.sh
```

Make sure you use the correct syntax asked in the subject:
```
Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping
◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking
◦ timestamp_in_ms X died
Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
and X with the philosopher number.

```
